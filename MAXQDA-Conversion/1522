"SIDM? is intended to be used both as a design and evaluation tool. As a design tool, it i) guides 
the design of sustainable infrastructure solutions, ii) can be used as a progress check to assess the 
level of completion of a project, iii) highlights gaps in the existing information sets, and iv) essen-
tially provides the scope of work required to advance the design process. As an evaluation tool it can 
act both as a quick diagnostic tool, to check whether or not a solution has major flaws or is generally 
acceptable, and as a detailed evaluation tool where various options can be compared in detail in 
order to establish a preferred solution.

"raft of challenges for implementing this option were identified. These included 
asset management issues, political reluctance to adopt change, and an unequal scrutiny on technical 
aspects of business-as-usual versus any alternative options. Even with a strong business case favour-
ing Option 2, some stakeholders were still indecisive, and took some time to work on internal 
processes before finally supporting the proposed solution. This eventual agreement amongst all 
stakeholders was achieved by the progressive working through of issues and identification of the 
necessary institutional changes needed to advance the alternative solutions.
The key barriers were found to be associated with entrenched institutional cultures and difficulties 
in implementing new asset management arrangements that do not accord with existing risk profiles 
and/or business objectives",40333,41209,https://amphora.asu.edu/amphora/resource/1522,Challenges
